## Setting Up Your Voice AI Agent

Follow these steps to set up the profile for your AI agent.

## Accessing the Profile Settings

## Configuring Basic Settings

1. **Give Your AI Agent a Name**

2. **Select the Timezone**
   - Choose the relevant timezone for your AI agent. This is important for accurate logging of all interactions, especially if your business operates across different regions.

3. **Choose the Language**
   - From the drop-down list, select the language you want your AI agent to use. Options may include English, Spanish, French, and more.

4. **Pick the AI Voice**
   - Select the voice for your AI agent from the given options. You can preview each voice to find the one that best suits your needs.
<Tip> If your AI agent handles customer service, consider a voice that’s calm and reassuring, while a more dynamic voice might suit a sales-oriented AI agent.</Tip>
