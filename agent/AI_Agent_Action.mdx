Choose when the SMS can be triggered:
- **Inbound**: Only for incoming calls
- **Outbound**: Only for outgoing calls
- **Both**: Can be triggered for either call type

#### Trigger Timing
Select when the SMS should be sent:

### 3. Phone Number Configuration
Choose the recipient's phone number:
- **Caller's Number**: Automatically uses the caller's phone number
  - Only available for Phone Calls
- **Custom Number**: Manually specify a phone number to receive the SMS

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Best Practices for the Extract Info Feature">

  The **Extract Info** feature in our AI SaaS platform allows you to gather critical information from customer calls and interactions. Whether it's gathering customer preferences, contact details, or other situational data, the success of this feature depends on how you configure and manage the extracted fields.

  ### Common Challenge:
  
  When dealing with conditional or situational information (e.g., information provided only if asked or relevant), there’s a chance that the extracted fields in webhooks or reports may occasionally return empty or incomplete data. This could lead to missing insights or incomplete reports.

  To ensure you consistently get useful data for all extracted fields, even when specific details are not available, follow these best practices:

  ---

  ### 1. **Text Fields:**

  For information type **"text"**, it is common to face scenarios where the respondent might not provide any details. To handle this situation, use the following approach:

  - **Best Practice:** After your text prompt, always include a fallback instruction like:
      
      **“If no details, put ‘No Answer’.”**
      
      **Example:**
      
      *"Please provide details about your current issue. If no details, put 'No Answer.'”*
      

  This ensures that even if no answer is provided, your system logs "No Answer," keeping the data clean and complete.

  ---

  ### 2. **Number Fields:**

  For information type **"number"**, such as age or quantity, there may be instances where the respondent has no numeric input to provide.

  - **Best Practice:** After requesting a number, include this fallback:
      
      **“If no details, put '0'.”**
      
      **Example:**
      
      *"How many products are you looking for? If no details, put '0.'”*
      

  This guarantees that when there’s no input, a value of "0" is captured, which is easier to interpret in reports and calculations.

  ---

  ### 3. **Yes/No Fields:**

  For simple **"Yes/No"** responses, there might be cases where the respondent doesn’t explicitly provide an answer.

  - **Best Practice:** After your yes/no prompt, always include this fallback:
      
      **“If no details, put 'No'.”**
      
      **Example:**
      
      *"Are you satisfied with the product? If no details, put 'No.'”*
      

  Defaulting to "No" when no answer is given ensures that the response is logged as negative feedback unless explicitly confirmed otherwise.

  ---

  ### 4. **Multiple Choice Fields:**

  For **multiple choice** fields, you may encounter situations where none of the predefined options are selected.

  - **Best Practice:** Add an extra option that covers non-responses:
      
      **“If no details, select ‘No Answer.’”**
      
      **Example:**
      
      *"Which service are you using? (Option A, Option B, Option C, If no details, select 'No Answer.')”*
      

  This way, the system will always capture something from the interaction, preventing empty fields and enabling consistent reporting.

  ---

  ### Summary of Best Practices:

  - **Text fields:** Add “If no details, put ‘No Answer.’”
  - **Number fields:** Add “If no details, put ‘0.’”
  - **Yes/No fields:** Add “If no details, put ‘No.’”
  - **Multiple choice fields:** Add an extra option for “No Answer.”

  ---

  ### Why These Practices Are Important:

  1. **Data Completeness:** You avoid empty or missing data fields, making your reports more reliable and actionable.
  2. **Consistency in Reports:** These fallback responses ensure that every extracted field contains a usable value, even when no specific input is provided.
  3. **Streamlined Analysis:** With fallback data like “No Answer” or “0,” you can run consistent analyses without manual data cleaning or handling null values.

  By following these practices, you’ll maximize the efficiency of the **Extract Info** feature and maintain a higher level of data integrity across all interactions.
